# Maven-Sales-Challenge

## **About this project**

### **Project Challenge:**

MavenTech needed to leverage their CRM data to gain insights into their sales performance and make data-driven decisions. My challenge was to create an interactive dashboard that provided a comprehensive view of their quarterly sales performance.

### **Objective:**

Empower sales managers with the tools they need to track their team's performance and identify areas for improvement.

### **Role:**

As the BI Developer for MavenTech, my role was to analyze B2B sales data from their CRM system and create an interactive dashboard. This dashboard would empower sales managers to track their team's quarterly performance and make data-driven decisions.

### **About The Data Set:**

This dataset comprises B2B sales opportunities from our CRM database. It includes crucial information on accounts, products, sales teams, and sales opportunities. This rich dataset will serve as the foundation for our data-driven approach to sales management.
